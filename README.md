## The Driver Application is implemented using React app as front end and for backend we had used MongoDB and Express Server. 

### Some overview of our application :

1. SingUp Page 
```
The registered driver need to install the application and logged in into the application by the username & password provided by the Transport Officer 
```

<br>
2. Dashboard 

```
After sucessfully being logged in, the application will ask permission to allow their location. 
```
> Note : Without providing the correct location it wont mesure the distance travelled by the vehicle

3. The dashboard will display the current location of vehicle as well as important information such as  vehicle registration number, driver name, vehicle name etc

4. Activity page 
```
After some trips the driver can view thier trip history how much they had travelled.
Currently it is empty
```
